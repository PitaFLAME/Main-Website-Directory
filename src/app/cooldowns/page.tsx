                        Welcome to my Cooldowns App project page. This Lifestyle app for mobile 
                        platforms was developed using Dart and is designed to help manage impulsivity 
                        and keep users accountable to the goals they want to set for themselves. Whether 
                        you want to keep yourself from eating out too often, manage breaks from your workout 
                        or study, this life-gamifying application seeks to aid you.
                        </p>

                        In its current state, the app allows you to choose from a short list of icons to 
                        represent your Cooldown, and customize the recharge time, number of charges, and the 
                        recharge style for it. On the main Cooldowns view, your created Cooldowns will appear 
                        as either available, or with a "dimmed" overlay to indicate how long it will be until 
                        it is available again. The idea is to discourage the user from performing a specific 
                        action that they want to limit by treating that action as "On Cooldown", or unavailable to them.

                            The app will be empty when you first download it, so the first thing you should do is create 
                            a new Cooldown. Creating new Cooldowns is fairly straightforward. You can specify the name of 
                            the Cooldown, its duration, and choose from a currently short list of icons to represent it on 
                            the main screen.</p>

                        You can also expand the "Advanced" menu to specify a number of charges the cooldown has, and how 
                        those charges recharge. For Parallel, each expended charge of the Cooldown will recharge independently 
                        from one another. In Series, however, only one charge will recharge at a time and once one charge is 
                        available, the next one will begin recharging.
